+ Applying LDA to posts containing URLs does not seem sensible because:
- posts sometimes only contain URL without accompanying text.
- the post is not self-explanatory in itself because it just one message from 
an ongoing chat so all posts that are part of the chat have to considered to
derive a meaningful topic.


+ I have to see what Github contributors talk about in Gitter chats.
- probably author topic models can help here.
